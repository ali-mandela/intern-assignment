This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js. Verify installation by running `npm -v` in your terminal.

## Note

As I was unable to get the images from Figma, I have used random images from [Picsum Photos](https://picsum.photos/).
